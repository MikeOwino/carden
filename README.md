## Self-hosting Carden
You can run Screenity locally without having to install it from the Chrome Store. Here's how:

1. Download the code. In the web version of GitHub, you can do that by clicking the green "Code" button, and then "Download ZIP".
2. Note that there's a [server](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/carden/tree/master/server) folder for the back-end. You will need to setup a server with a MySQL database.
3. Add the appropriate credentials in [config.php](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/carden/tree/master/server/config.php) to access your database.
4. Modify the access-control-allow-origin in all PHP files to allow requests from the extension (with its unique ID).
5. Replace the POST URLs throughout the javascript files in the [chrome-extension](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/carden/tree/master/chrome-extension) folder.
6. Go to chrome://extensions/ in your browser, and [enable developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
7. Drag the [chrome-extension](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/carden/tree/master/chrome-extension) folder (make sure it's a folder and not a ZIP file, so unzip first), or click on the "Load unpacked" button and locate the folder.
4. That's it, you will now be able to use Carden locally. Make sure you pin it on the toolbar by clicking the "puzzle" icon in the toolbar and pinning Carden.
